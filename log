    when I decided to write a light web server by lua, I did known 
how it started, even I could not write a makefile.
    Its make me upset, I search in the internet for web server, for 
makefile, I learned a new way to debug makefile, it a amazing ! very
good script for debug the makefile. And I learned how to use VIM to 
edit files in one window, even though I was used vim some year, but 
I did not know how to use it effective. Te commamd is usefull.
    I found a intersting shell script for test bash bug by the coolshell
blog: 
    X='() { (a)=>\' sh -c "echo date"; cat echo
    
    But I did not one line code!
